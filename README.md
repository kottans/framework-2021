# Framework

A gradual FE JS framework development.

## End game

Have a web app as a practical implementation
of an application backed with a basic FE framework.

Framework features:
- components with props
- html-like syntax
- app state management
- event handling
- async network requests

Out of scope:
- reconciliation
- app state persistency between sessions
- everything else :)

## Development

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`npm start` to launch dev server, app would be served at http://localhost:1234/

`npm run build` to build production distribution package

`npm run deploy` to publish built app
